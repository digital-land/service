A service for users to search for and across planning documents.

## Why is this service needed

The discoverability of planning information is extremely low.

The majority of planning information is locked up in pdf documents. These documents are hard to find. Once found it is hard to find the information you need.

We are creating a [service to collect documents](../collect-documents-service), once we have collected the documents and processed them we want to create a service to help users search them.

There are 2 main types of search a user would like to perform:

* search for particular documents, e.g. find all local plan documents for Lambeth
* search for documents related to a subject, e.g. find all documents that mention climate change

### Hypotheses

* allowing users to search for documents using the data we have collected about them will improve the discoverability of planning information
* understanding what documents users search will help to steer us towards other data that should be standardised and extracted from documents
* letting users find documents that mention topic areas will open up planning information to a wider audience

##Â What we've done so far

We hope to look at this in Q2 2021.
