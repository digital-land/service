A service to help manage MHCLG data. This includes a list of permitted development rights and a list of developer contribution purpose categories.

## Why is this service needed

There are a number of lists of data owned and managed by MHCLG. We need to be able to update these lists when things change.

We are building [a product to help manage lists](/product/maintain-a-list-tool) and want to make a service around that to help us and MHCLG colleagues manage our lists.

The service will need to help us manage:

* permitted development rights
* use classes
* developer contribution purposes
* development plan document types

### Hypotheses

* a single service to manage lists of data will be easier for the digital land team to operate

##Â What we've done so far

We currently maintain the lists in github.

We are getting to the point where it would be easier to maintain the lists of data with a service.

We have created the [permitted development rights data](https://digital-land.github.io/permitted-development-right/) from the legislation. This needs to be maintained.
