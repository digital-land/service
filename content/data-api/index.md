A service to access land and housing data via an API.

## Why is this service needed

Some users of Digital Land's data will want to access the data via an API instead of downloading a data package.

### Hypotheses

* in addition to downloading data packages some users will also want to build their products onto of APIs that we make available

## What we've done so far

For each of the things we've collected you can visit a URL and retrieve the relevant data. For example, the [conservation area for Vassall Road](https://digital-land.github.io/conservation-area/local-authority-eng/LBH/CA7/geometry.geojson) in Lambeth.
