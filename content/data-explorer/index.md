A service for users to find data that we've collected on Digital Land.

## Why is this service needed

As we collected more land and housing data we want to provide users with a way of searching and finding the data that they need. The data explorer could also be useful in helping users discover data that they didn't realise was available.

### Hypotheses

* users will want to search for data in a number of ways. For example, by dataset or by local authority area. By typology or by publication date

## What we've done so far

Based on the GOV.UK [specalist publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/specialist-publisher) we've built a [tool to help users explore and find local plans data](https://digital-land.github.io/local-plan/) that we've collected. Elements of this could potentially be re-used for the data explorer.
